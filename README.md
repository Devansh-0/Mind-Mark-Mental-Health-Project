# Mind Mark: Employee Analysis Tool

The COVID 19 Pandemic forced all the organisations and corporations to seize their operations and ask all of employees to work from their respective homes. This was a sudden change in the work environment and people somehow adapted.
After several months, with things turning back to normal gradually, it is the responsibility of the corporation to make the transition to office workpalace as smooth as possible.

## What does the application do?
Mind Mark presents the employees with a set of subjective questions. Employees answer those questions and based on their respones a Satisfaction Quotient is generated.
- This score ranges from -100 to +100 and tells how satisfied are the employees with the transition.
- It also generates key topics on which their responses are primarily based. The organisation can now analyse the responses and take required steps for the benefits of their employees.
